# lightsec-tools
Light Security Tools: browser-based utilities for password strength, hashing, Base64 encode/decode, and ROT ciphers. Clean UI, modular, and easy to us

---

✅ This README covers:  
- All your tools  
- Features and folder structure  
- How to use locally  
- Best practices  
- Author info  

If you want, I can also **draft the short GitHub repo description** that appears at the top (about section) so it’s concise but includes all tools.  

Do you want me to do that next?
